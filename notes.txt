movq   64-bits
movl   32-bits
movw   16-bits
movb    8-bits

syscall

addq
subq

incq
decq

mulq   -- multiplies rax by source
divq   -- divides rax by source; remainder in rdx
          which should be set to 0 before division


16 general purpose registers
----------------------------
%rax, %rbx, %rcx, %rdx
%rsi, %rdi, %rbp, %rsp
%r8 -- %r15

%r11d  <- 32-bits
%r11w  <- 16-bits
%r11b  <-  8-bits

special purpose registers
-------------------------
%rip
%eflags -- ZF (zero flag), CF (carry flag)

jz      -- jump if zero
jnz     -- jump if not zero
jc      -- jump if carry
jnc     -- jump if not carry

cmpq    ARG1,   ARG2

je      jump if ARG2 == ARG1
jne     jump if ARG2 <> ARG1
ja      jump if ARG2 >  ARG1
jae     jump if ARG2 >= ARG1
jb      jump if ARG2 <  ARG1
jbe     jump if ARG2 <= ARG1


The suffixes on the jump instruction -- e, ne, a, ae, b, be --
are known as condition codes.

---------------------------
cmovgq    %rax,        %rbx
---------------------------
The above instruction will move the contents of %rax into %rbx
if the previous comparison determined a "greater than"
condition. Likewise,
----------------------------
cmovleq   %rax,         %rbx
----------------------------
will do the same if it was a "less than or equal to" condition.

-------------
loopq   label
-------------
loop instruction does the following
1. decq %rcx   (decrement %rcx)
2. jnz  label  (jump if result of decrement is not zero).



Glorious Archangel St Raphael, great prince of the heavenly
court, you are illustrious for your gifts of wisdom and grace.
You are a guide of those who journey by land or sea or air,
consoler of the afflicted, and refuge of sinners. I beg you,
assist me in all my needs and in all the sufferings of this life.
In particular, help my marriage be healed, our hearts reconciled
and our souls saved.



Glorious Archangel Saint Raphael,
great prince of the heavenly court,
you are illustrious
for your gifts of wisdom and grace.
You are a guide of those who journey
by land or sea or air,
consoler of the afflicted,
and refuge of sinners.
I beg you,
assist me in all my needs
and in all the sufferings of this life,
as once you helped
the young Tobias on his travels.
Because you are the medicine of God,
I humbly pray you to heal the many infirmities
of my soul and the ills that afflict my body.
I especially ask of you the favor

(Make your request here...)

and the great grace of purity
to prepare me to be the temple of the Holy Spirit.

Amen.

St. Raphael,
of the glorious seven
who stand before the throne of Him
who lives and reigns,
Angel of health,
the Lord has filled your hand
with balm from heaven
to soothe or cure our pains.
Heal or cure the victim of disease.
And guide our steps when doubtful of our ways.
Amen.
